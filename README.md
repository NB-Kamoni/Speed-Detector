# Speed Detector 
## Introduction
This program calculates demerit points based on the input speed and displays the result in the HTML page. If the speed is less than or equal to 70 km/h, it prints "Ok." If the speed is above 70 km/h, it calculates demerit points according to the given conditions and prints the total demerit points, along with a message indicating whether the license is suspended if the demerit points exceed 12.
